# Contributing

I (Cliff Paulick) lead this repository&mdash;its goals, future, planning, vision, etc.&mdash;and will review contributions both objectively and subjectively.

I welcome your contributions to help this repository be a top-quality starting point for any simple or complex plugin, whether brand new or the start of a refactor.

All contributions are subject to this repository's license terms. Additionally, you grant Cliff permission to retroactively change your contributions to any other license type adopted by this repo, such as from GPL to LGPL or MIT. *Do not contribute unless you agree to all of this repo's terms.*

While many developers work on fixing bugs and creating new features, it
is worth strong emphasis that even non-programmers can help make this more powerful and successful.

You probably already have an idea of something you'd like to work on. If not, here are just a few ways you
can help:

* Log a bug or feature request, optionally also submitting a pull request for it.
* Add helpful comments to existing open issues and pull requests.
* Add documentation to this repo, including code comments and dedicated documentation files.
* Author a _how-to_ describing a trick or technique you've figured out.
* Write an external article advocating for this repo.

Any and all contributions take effort, which is acknowledged and greatly appreciated.

Please note that this project is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct. By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Issues

Issues are very valuable to this project.

* Ideas are a valuable source of contributions others can make.
* Problems show where this project is lacking.
* With a question you show where contributors can improve the user experience, including documentation.

Thank you for creating them.

## Pull Requests (PRs)

PRs are a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

PRs may get merged as-is, changes requested, forked to take it in a different direction, or declined.

### Does it state intent?

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your contribution.

For example, if your message is:

> Add a link to code of conduct in README.md

That doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that, but...

> Add a link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always look in the CONTRIBUTING.md

Tells me the problem that you have found. Then the PR shows me the action you have taken to solve it.

### Is it of good quality?

* There are no spelling or grammatical mistakes.
* It makes sense and is easy to read.
* It follows conventions.
