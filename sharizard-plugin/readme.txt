Here is a short description of the plugin's purpose & functionality. It should be no more than 150 characters or fewer. No markup is allowed in here.

== Description ==

This is the long description. No limit, and you can use Markdown (as well as in the following sections).

For backwards compatibility, if this section is missing, the full length of the short description will be used, and
Markdown parsed.

A few notes about the sections above:

* "Contributors" is a comma separated list of wp.org/wp-plugins.org usernames
* "Tags" is a comma separated list of tags that apply to the plugin (maximum of 3-5 tags)
* "Requires at least" is the lowest version of WordPress that the plugin will work on
* "Tested up to" is the highest version that you've *successfully used to test the plugin*. Note that it might work on higher versions... this is just the highest one you've verified.
* Stable tag should indicate the Subversion "tag" of the latest stable version, or "trunk," if you use `/trunk/` for
stable.

Note that the `readme.txt` of the stable tag is the one that is considered the defining one for the plugin, so
if the `/trunk/readme.txt` file says that the stable tag is `4.3`, then it is `/tags/4.3/readme.txt` that'll be used
for displaying information about the plugin. In this situation, the only thing considered from the trunk `readme.txt`
is the stable tag pointer. Thus, if you develop in trunk, you can update the trunk `readme.txt` to reflect changes in
your in-development version, without having that information incorrectly disclosed about the current stable version
that lacks those changes -- as long as the trunk's `readme.txt` points to the correct stable tag.

If no stable tag is provided, it is assumed that trunk is stable, but you should specify "trunk" if that's where
you put the stable version, in order to eliminate any doubt.

== Installation ==

== Screenshots ==

See https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/plugin-assets/ for image dimensions

1. A caption for `screenshot-1.png`

2. A caption for `screenshot-2.png`


== Arbitrary section ==

You may provide arbitrary sections, in the same format as the ones above. This may be of use for extremely complicated
plugins where more information needs to be conveyed that doesn't fit into the categories of "description" or
"installation." Arbitrary sections will be shown below the built-in sections outlined above.

Titles are optional, naturally.

Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
